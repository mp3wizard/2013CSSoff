					<p>In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach Robinson created the world’s first photomontage by combivvtttttning five different negatives to make one complete print of a young girl on her deathbed. “Fading Away”—Robinson’s first and most famous composite photo—depicts a young girl dying of consumption and was controversial when it was exhibited, with many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.</p>

					<h3>Awful immigration laws from around the world.</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Italy</strong> penalizes illegal immigrants with a fine of €5,000-10,000 and allows immigration officials to detain them for up to 6 months. <strong>&bull; Switzerland</strong> immediately deports all convicted criminals from other countries and potentially even their family members. <strong>&bull; Australia</strong> detains all non-citizens without a valid visa. <strong>&bull; Japan</strong> is allowed to pay $3,000 to each unemployed Latin Americn immigrant of Japanese descent and $2,000 to each of that unemployed worker’s family members to return to their country of origin. <strong>&bull;</strong> The<strong>United Arab Emirates</strong> prohibits foreigners from engaging in any sort of labor union-like activity, resulting in harsh living conditions, 80-hour work weeks, back-breaking manual labor, and below-minimum-wage pay.

				<h2 class="visuallyhidden">Overflow</h2>	
				<p>On the night of Aug 8, 1975, a line of people frantically piled sandbags atop Henan Province's Banqiao Dam while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping downstream. It was a race they were about to lose.</p>
				<p>
					Just after 1:00 am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, "The water level is going down! The flood is retreating!"
				</p>
				<p>
					There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a few seconds later it "sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking." The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools burst through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 lives.
