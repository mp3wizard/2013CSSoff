					<h3>Awful immigration laws from around the world.</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Italy</strong> penalizes illegal immigrants with a fine of €5,000-10,000 and allows immigration officials to detain them for up to 6 months. <strong>&bull; Switzerland</strong> immediately deports all convicted criminals from other countries and potentially even their family members. <strong>&bull; Australia</strong> detains all non-citizens without a valid visa. <strong>&bull; Japan</strong> is allowed to pay $3,000 to each unemployed Latin Americn immigrant of Japanese descent and $2,000 to each of that unemployed worker’s family members to return to their country of origin. <strong>&bull;</strong> The<strong>United Arab Emirates</strong> prohibits foreigners from engaging in any sort of labor union-like activity, resulting in harsh living conditions, 80-hour work weeks, back-breaking manual labor, and below-minimum-wage pay.

				<h2 class="visuallyhidden">Overflow</h2>	
				<p>On the night of Aug 8, 1975, a line of people frantically piled sandbags atop Henan Province's Banqiao Dam while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping downstream. It was a race they were about to lose.</p>
